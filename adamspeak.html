          <h2>Hiking to Adam’s Peak in the middle of the night</h2>
          <p>
            It is two o’clock in the morning
            and still a bit sleepy we climb the first of 5,500 steps. Yes, you read it correctly.
            All the way up to the top of Adam’s Peak are long staircases. Together with Canadians
            Dez and Emmy, we are doing this physical challenge. At first sight, it seems as we are
            the only ones hiking this trail, but after half an hour of walking, we also meet some
            other tourists. It’s a bit weird, walking with our torches in the middle of the night
            while all the temples are abandoned, shops closed and lights are out. 
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>The first hour is easy peasy, then it gets more challenging</h2>
          <p>
            The start of the hike is easy.
            We walk on flat parts and us ascent gradually on the stairs. But the further we go, the steeper
            the stairs become. Occasionally, we take a break to catch our breath. Along the way, we
            see poles that count down to the top. Pole 21 was the start and from pole 9 we only see
            steep stairs going up. The group we are walking with has grown in the meantime. We walk
            among 20 people of all different nationalities. It looks like a pilgrimage, but it really
            isn’t, the real pilgrimages only start in a week, at the first full moon of December.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Sunrise on Adam’s Peak</h2>
          <p>
            Slowly, it starts to get lighter. The sky changes from black
            to deep blue, dark purple, orange and then … nothing… Just before sunrise, we are 
            suddenly caught in a thick fog bank. There is nothing to see anymore, no sun, no beautiful 
            valley, nothing at all. I cannot believe this is happening right now. We skipped one night 
            for this! One night of precious sleep! What a disappointment!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>The tough descent from Adam’s Peak</h2>
          <p>
            When the sun shines brightly high in the sky, 
            we begin to descend. It is still cold, but that will soon change. The lower we get, 
            the hotter it is. The 5500 steps that we climbed up are perhaps even heavier to go 
            down. Everyone has trembling leg muscles and cramped calves. I am happy with the 
            walking stick I bought in Nepal, which takes a lot of pressure off my knees.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Don’t underestimate the cold!</h2>
          <p>
            What can make the climb of Adam’s Peak tough
            is the time you climb. With just a few hours of sleep or no sleep at all 
            combined with the cold on the mountain, it can be physically challenging. 
            We had definitly underestimated the cold when you reach the top. Since we 
            had to wait a bit before sunrise, we all were shivering with cold at the top. 
            At the starting point of the trail it was still 23 degrees, but 1000 meters higher 
            the wind was blowing strong and it was no warmer than 5 degrees. Absolutely bring 
            gloves, a hat and a thick jacket if you can!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Climbing Adam’s Peak difficult?</h2>
          <p>
            We found the climb to Adam’s Peak 
            not very difficult. If you are in normal shape, this mountain is definitly doable. 
            Of course, there are many stairs and you climb more than 1000 meters, but the stairs 
            are reasonably well maintained. There are also poles that indicate which part of the 
            hike you are on. These divide the hike into 21 equal parts, so you can estimate how 
            far you are. Finally, there is a tea shop every few hundred meters where you can catch your breath.
